Test automation framework for [Concordion](http://concordion.org).

Cubano is a "ready-made" framework that provides everything at your fingertips. It's ideal for someone new to testing who wants to use Concordion.

The framework is ideal for:

* Web testing using Selenium WebDriver
* REST / SOAP / HTTP using the built-in HttpEasy framework, or plug in your own
* Database

It encourages collaboration and communication between business people, testers and developers. The rich output presents multiple views of the specification with embedded storyboards and logs containing screenshots, HTML page source, message interactions and text.

The framework is easy to configure, for example supported browsers are simple to install locally using the Managed WebDriver, or in the cloud using SauceLabs or BrowserStack. It supports standard patterns for Page Objects and Components to provide the right level of abstraction for web pages.
