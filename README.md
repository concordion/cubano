# cubano

Cubano is a "ready-made" test framework that provides everything at your fingertips. It's ideal for software delivery teams who want to collaborate around living documentation.

Utilising __Specification by Example__ techniques, the framework implements:

* Web browser automation using Selenium WebDriver
* API automation (REST / SOAP / HTTP)
* Database automation

Cubano supplies [User Documentation](https://concordion.org/cubano/index), and a [Demo Project](https://github.com/concordion/cubano-demo#cubano-demo-project), to help users get started. 

It encourages collaboration and communication between business people, testers and developers. The rich output presents multiple views of the specification with embedded storyboards and logs containing screenshots, HTML page source, message interactions and text.

The framework is easy to configure, for example supported browsers are simple to install locally using the Managed WebDriver, or in the cloud using SauceLabs or BrowserStack. It supports standard patterns for Page Objects and Components to provide the right level of abstraction for web pages.

It is built in Java using [Concordion](https://concordion.org) and incorporates numerous extensions.

## Cubano Demo and Template Projects
Cubano provides a [Demo Project](https://github.com/concordion/cubano-demo#cubano-demo-project), which contains information regarding
* usage
* documentation
* working examples 
* and set up instructions 

Once you are ready to start writing your own tests, pull down the [Cubano Template Project](https://github.com/concordion/cubano-template) and adapt this base to start automating your project.

	Use the following check configuration for all files: Cubano - (Global)

## Releasing

To create a release, you will need to run `gradlew clean test javadoc build sourcesJar javadocJar publishDocs release bintrayUpload`. This depends on having appropriate permissions to publish to the Concordion organisation. The build takes over 15 minutes since it also releases to Maven Central. It will then take about another 15 minutes for the artifacts to appear in [Maven Central](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/concordion/). 

To build a local release and publish to your local Maven repository, you can run `gradlew clean publishToMavenLocal`.
